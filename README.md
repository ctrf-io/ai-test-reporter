# AI Test Reporter

AI Test Reporter is a powerful tool that generates intelligent summaries of test results using a wide range of AI models. With access to over 300 models through various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, Perplexity, OpenRouter, and more), it analyzes failing tests and provides actionable insights about what went wrong and how to fix it.

2. Identify potential root causes
3. Suggest specific fixes
4. Highlight patterns across multiple failures

When consolidation is enabled (`--consolidate`), the AI analyzes all test failures AI summaries together to provide a high-level summary of issues.

### Test Object

For each failing test, the AI receives the complete test object.

### Environment Context

The complete environment details from the `environment` object in the CTRF report is provided to the AI model.

### Tool Context

The complete tool details from the `tool` object in the CTRF report is provided to the AI model.

## Charges

You are responsible for any charges incurred from using the AI models. Make sure you are aware of the associated costs.
